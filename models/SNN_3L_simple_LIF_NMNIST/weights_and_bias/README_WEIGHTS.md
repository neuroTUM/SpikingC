### Explanation on how stored weights are organized

- The first value in each row represents the weight of the connection from the first input neuron to the respective output neuron indicated by the row number.
- The last value in the first row represents the weight of the connection from the last input neuron to the first output neuron.
- This pattern repeats for each row, where each row corresponds to a different output neuron, and the values in the row represent the weights from all input neurons to that output neuron.
